# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a Mobile Engineer specializing in iOS development

As a skilled mobile engineer with experience in programming languages such as Swift and frameworks like SwiftUI and UIKit, I have a track record of delivering successful projects for a variety of clients. My work experience includes developing applications for companies such as Insight Global, YesHog LLC, and Astronaut 3 Media Group.

In my most recent role with TEKsystems, I have been using the MVVM architecture along with SwiftUI to modernize legacy code and create new features. Prior to that, I worked with Insight Global on a contract with Webhead, where I utilized modern Apple frameworks like SwiftUI, Combine, and Swift Package Manager to build a suite of applications.

One of my standout projects was with YesHog LLC, where I developed UNpkl 1.0 from scratch and had the pleasure to come back and build out version 2.0 by refining the design and adding new features using SwiftUI and MapKit. I also implemented StoreKit for a cloud subscription feature, allowing users to access the app on the go.

My dedication to delivering high-quality work and my expertise in Swift and various Apple frameworks make me a valuable asset to any team.
